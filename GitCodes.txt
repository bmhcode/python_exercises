ls : list of files in the directory
ls -a : all files with cached files

git init                                  // if you want to start a new repo locally 
git clone <repo-url>                      // repo in github you want to start working with it locally
git status                                // To check the current status of the repo
git status -s Or git status --short       // To get a short description of the status
git add . or git add <file-name>          // To add a file to the repo Or to add a modified file to the staged files
git commit -m "<commit-message>"             To make the commit

//Ignoring files

 - you can ignore files by adding the into .gitignore file with some extension like (ext , .html, .py),
 
// Removing Files :

- git rm <file-name>             removes the file from tracked files and remove it frome the directory it self.
- git rm --cached <file-name>    To remove a file only from git 

// The History :

- git log                        To get the history of the repo

EB: Working With Remotes :

git Remotes
origin
git remote -v
git remote add <shortname> <url>
git pull origin master
git push <remote-name> <branch-name>   Example : git push origin main

Branches :
git branch <branch-name>                       To create a branch
git checkout branch <branch-name>              To checkout to a branch
git checkout 8cf3ed74e0510c164578f9cf80916d    To checkout to a Hush
git branch -d <branch-name>                    To remove a branch
git checkout -b <branch-name>                  To create a branch and checkout to that branch in one command
git branch                                     To get the branches in the repo and to know in with branch you are in 
git status                                     When there is a conflict and the merge is bending and you want to see with files are causing the conflict

git init
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/example_repo.git
git push -u origin main


These two steps worked for me!
Step 1:
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/username/example_repo.git
Step 2:
git push --set-upstream -f origin main



update files
git add .
git commit -m "comment"
git push origin main
